BMW I-BUS INJECTOR PROJECT README

This i-bus injector project reads 4 * 12 volt I/O lines and injects their status onto the car i-bus.

The PIC code checks that the bus is quiet and then writes a custom message onto the bus when any of the I/O lines change status. If there is bus contention while the message is written, it will write it out again unit it has been sent without errors.

It can easily be adapted to read something like a retro fitted i-drive controller to control A/V and navigation functions. Other uses are also possible by modifing the code and electronics.The code can also be made to look for certain i-bus messages and react to them, making some sort of custom function module.

I have included a circuit diagram that includes a very basic but functional i-bus interface connected directly to the PIC processor.

The crystal oscillator is optional, I recommend using the internal oscillator to save cost and complexity.The extra I/O lines might also come in handy.

The picture shows the inside of my unit which was based on the PCB of a previous PIC based project I created. It's just for reference.

The i-bus messages it creates look something like:



"F2 04 F3 00 08 0D"

F2 - source module address (F2 is my data injector module address)
04 - length in bytes of the rest of the data packet
F3 - destination module address (F3 is a dummy address)
00 - command type, set to zero as default
08 - data for the command - this contains a bit field of the status of the various I/O lines 
0D - XOR checksum

Currently any i-bus packets with "F2" at the beginning are from the i-bus injector.

To use this project to contol other functions of the car simply replace the custom messages with the messages you require.

To do any sort of work on the BMW i-bus, I recommend the NavCoder i-bus software and the Resler i-bus interface (serial and USB).

I fitted 5 pin DIN sockets to my car in the boot and centre console that exposed the battery +, ignition +, GND and i-bus. It made experimentation much easier.

Good luck
